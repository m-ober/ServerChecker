# ServerChecker

A simple, yet very useful tool to manage one or many gameservers in
one place. For supported servers/protocols, ServerChecker
directly communicates with the server and will restart it upon
a failure - even if the process is still running.

The original author of this software seems to have abandoned it,
as there was no update for quite some time and now even
the webpage is no longer reachable.

## Build

For Visual Studio 2013, the Multibyte MFC Library is required:

ServerChecker will keep supported servers up and running
